# PrepArena Fixes Implementation

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the issues mentioned in the problem statement.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. AWS S3 Migration for File Storage
**Problem**: Files were stored on Render as ephemeral files, making them inaccessible and not persistent.

**Solution**:
- Added AWS S3 integration with `aws-sdk` package
- Created `server/config/s3.js` for S3 operations
- Modified `server/routes/upload.js` to use S3 storage when configured
- Updated `server/routes/test.js` to serve files from S3 with signed URLs
- Files are now stored persistently and accessible to all users

**Configuration Required**:
- Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_S3_BUCKET` environment variables
- See `server/.env.example` for configuration template

### 2. Test Runner Scroll Issues
**Problem**: Random scrolling behavior during test execution, especially when nearing submission.

**Solution**:
- Added scroll prevention logic with `isSubmittingRef`
- Set `scrollBehavior: "auto"` to prevent smooth scrolling
- Added focus prevention on submit button during submission
- Fixed layout to prevent automatic scroll to submit button

### 3. OMR Answer Persistence
**Problem**: Answers were lost on page reload.

**Solution**:
- Added localStorage persistence for test answers
- Answers are saved automatically as they're entered
- Answers are loaded when returning to test
- Saved answers are cleared after successful submission

### 4. Multiple Submission Prevention
**Problem**: Users could re-enter tests they had already submitted.

**Solution**:
- Modified `checkRegistration` API to include submission status
- Added submission check in TestRunner to prevent re-entry
- Users who have submitted are redirected to test bridge with notification

### 5. File Access Issues
**Problem**: Uploaded test papers not visible to other users.

**Solution**:
- S3 integration ensures files are accessible globally
- Secure PDF serving with signed URLs
- Fallback to local storage when S3 not configured
- Proper error handling for missing files

## Technical Implementation Details

### AWS S3 Integration
```javascript
// S3 configuration with fallback
const isS3Configured = () => {
  return !!(process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID && 
           process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY && 
           process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET);
};
```

### Answer Persistence
```javascript
// Auto-save to localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  if (!testId || !isTestStarted) return;
  const storageKey = `test_answers_${testId}`;
  localStorage.setItem(storageKey, JSON.stringify(answers));
}, [answers, testId, isTestStarted]);
```

### Submission Prevention
```javascript
// Check submission status before allowing entry
const hasSubmitted = Boolean(r.data?.hasSubmitted);
if (hasSubmitted && !isCreator) {
  navigate(`/test/${link}`);
  return;
}
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Railway Deployment
- Use `railway.env.example` as reference for environment variables
- Ensure AWS S3 credentials are set in Railway dashboard
- Files will be stored in S3, not local filesystem

### Render Deployment  
- Updated `render.yaml` with AWS S3 environment variables
- Disk storage remains as fallback when S3 not configured
- Set AWS credentials in Render dashboard

## Migration Guide

1. **Set up AWS S3 bucket**:
   - Create S3 bucket with private access
   - Create IAM user with S3 permissions
   - Configure CORS policy for your domain

2. **Update environment variables**:
   - Add AWS credentials to deployment platform
   - Set bucket name and region

3. **Test file uploads**:
   - Upload new test papers to verify S3 integration
   - Check file accessibility from different user accounts

4. **Monitor submission tracking**:
   - Verify users cannot re-enter completed tests
   - Check answer persistence across page reloads

## Breaking Changes

- None - all changes are backward compatible
- Existing local files will continue to work
- S3 storage is opt-in via environment variables

## Performance Improvements

- Files served via CDN when using S3
- Reduced server load for file serving
- Better error handling for missing files
- Optimized scroll behavior in test runner
